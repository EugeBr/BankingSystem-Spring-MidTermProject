- Spring Framework is a widely used Java framework that provides a flexible and modular approach to building enterprise-grade applications. It simplifies the development process by reducing boilerplate code and providing powerful features such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and transaction management.
- Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework and provides an opinionated approach to building production-grade Spring applications quickly and easily. It includes embedded servers, pre-configured dependencies, and auto-configuration of Spring components, among other features.
- Maven is a popular build automation tool that simplifies the build process of Java applications. It provides a declarative way to specify the project dependencies and build steps, making it easy to manage and maintain large projects.
- MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system that provides a scalable and reliable platform for storing and retrieving data. It is known for its performance, reliability, and ease of use.
- JUnit 5 is a widely used testing framework for Java applications that provides a set of tools for writing and executing tests to ensure the quality and correctness of the application. It includes features such as assertions, parameterized tests, and test suites.
